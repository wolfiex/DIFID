# Data files
- `doc_information.csv` contains basic bibliographic information about each document, which is identified by the `id` column

- `locations.csv` contains approximate location data extracted from the documents (with in many cases multiple rows for multiple locations in documents). This can be merged with other document information via the `doc_id` column

- `topics.csv` contains information about each topic generated by a topic model (using NMF)

- `doctopics.csv` contains each doc-topic score calculated by the topic model

- `doctopic_wide.csv` contains the same data in wide format

- `tsne_results.csv` contains two tsne-generated dimensions for each document, identified by the `doc_id` column. The tsne algorithm is run on the wide form doctopic information.

- `label_tsne.csv` contains the position for each label in the tsne-generated topic space. The positions are generated by finding clusters of documents highly related to each topic and placing the label in the middle of each cluster. See the example in the `examples/topic_map`.
